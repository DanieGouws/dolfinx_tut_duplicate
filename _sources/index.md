# The FEniCS-X tutorial
Author: JÃ¸rgen S. Dokken

This web-page gives a concise overview of the functionality of [Dolfin-X](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx/), including a gentle introduction to the finite element method. This web-page is an adaptation of the [FEniCS tutorial](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319524610).

Dolfin-X can be used as either a C++ or Python software, but this tutorial will focus on Python programming, as it is the simplest and most effective approach for beginners. After having gone through this tutorial, the reader should familiarize themselves with the Dolfin-X [documentation](https://fenicsproject.org/docs/dolfinx/dev/python/), which includes the API and numerous demos.
